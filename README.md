OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT:
It is a basic calculator setup using tkinter in Python.

- I likely imported the necessary modules at the beginning of our code, such as tkinter for creating the GUI elements.
- I defined functions like `add_to_display`, `clear_display`, and `evaluate_expression`. These functions handle adding numbers or operators to the display, clearing the display, and evaluating the expression, respectively.
- And i created buttons for numbers 1 to 8 in your interface, which users can click to input these numbers into the calculator.
-  I added additional functions or code that handle arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
-  This code probably includes a main loop that runs the tkinter application and keeps it responsive to user interactions.
